PDF GENERATION NOTE
===================

This project includes full support for PDF generation with PlantUML and Mermaid diagrams.
However, PDF generation requires Ruby >= 2.7, and the current environment has Ruby 2.6.10.

DIAGRAM SUPPORT:
----------------
Both PlantUML and Mermaid diagrams are fully supported and working:
- The HTML output (icd-template.html) includes all diagrams rendered via Kroki service
- All 9 diagrams have been successfully generated as SVG files in build/images/
- Diagram types include: PlantUML (system context, architecture, sequence, state) and Mermaid (flowcharts, sequence, state diagrams)

TO GENERATE PDF:
----------------
Option 1 - Use Docker (Recommended):
  docker-compose run asciidoctor make pdf

Option 2 - Upgrade Ruby:
  Install Ruby 2.7 or later using rbenv, rvm, or system package manager
  Then run: bundle install && bundle exec make pdf

Option 3 - Use the HTML output:
  Open build/icd-template.html in a browser and print to PDF

VERIFICATION:
-------------
To verify all diagrams are rendering correctly:
  1. Open build/icd-template.html in a web browser
  2. Check that all 9 diagrams display properly:
     - System Context Diagram (PlantUML)
     - System Context Diagram (Mermaid)
     - Interface Architecture Diagram (PlantUML)
     - Interface Architecture Diagram (Mermaid)
     - Message Exchange Sequence (PlantUML)
     - Message Exchange Sequence (Mermaid)
     - Interface State Machine (PlantUML)
     - Interface State Machine (Mermaid)
     - Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid)

All SVG diagram files are available in: build/images/
